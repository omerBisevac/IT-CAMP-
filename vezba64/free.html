        <h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a<br /> web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control<br /> structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For<br/> example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks,<br /> form input, and page navigation</li>
            <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side<br/> extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the<br/> application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>

            <h1 id="wysak">What you should already know</h1>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the internet and the World Wide Web(WWW)</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 id="javascript">JavaScript and Java</h1>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not<br /> have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow<br /> constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <br />
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data<br /> types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based<br /> object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also<br /> supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
            <br />
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be<br /> concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function<br /> return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

            <h1 id="hello">Hello World</h1>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>

            <div class="codes">
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }<br />
                    greetMe("World");</code>
            </div>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h1 id="variables">Variables</h1>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because<br /> JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in<br /> identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1 id="declaring-variables">Declaring variables</h1>
            <p>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <div class="codes">
                <code>var x = 42.</code>
            </div>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <div class="codes">
                <code>
                    x = 42.
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>THis always declares a global variable.It generates a strict JavaScript Warning.You shuold't use this variant.</p>
            <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <div class="codes">
                <code>let y = 13.</code>
            </div>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1 id="variables-scope">Variable scope</h1>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document.<br /> When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global<br /> scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which<br /> x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
            <div class="codes">
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
            </div>
            <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
            <div class="codes">
                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not<br />
                    defined</code>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1 id="global-variables">Global variables</h1>
            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using<br /> the window.variable syntax.</p>
            <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame<br /> name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as<br /> parent.phoneNumber.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h1 id="constants">Constants</h1>
    <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must<br /> start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
    <div class="codes">
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
    </div>
<p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
<p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to<br /> represent a variable.</p>
<p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
<div class="codes">
    <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL<br />
        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements<br />
        }</code>
</div>
<p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
<div class="codes">
    <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>
</div>
</section>
<section>
    <h1 id="data-types">Data Types</h1>
    <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any<br /> other variant.</li>
                <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>and Object</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions<br /> are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your<br /> application can perform.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h1 id="if-else">if...else statement</h1>
    <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false.<br /> An if statement looks as follows:</p>
    <div class="codes">
        <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
    </div>
    <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition<br /> evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including<br /> further nested if statements.</p>
    <br />
    <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
    <div class="codes">
        <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;<br />
        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }</code>
    </div>
    <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them<br /> within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>
    <div class="codes">
        <code>
            if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;<br />
                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {<br />
                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;<br />
                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
        </code>
    </div>
    <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over<br /> the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
    <div class="codes">
        <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
    </div>
    <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For<br /> example:</p>
    <div class="codes">
        <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
    </div>
</section>
<section>
    <h1 id="while">While statmnet</h1>
    <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
    <div class="codes">
        <code>while (condition) statement</code>
    </div>
    <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.</p>
    <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested<br /> again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
    <p>
    To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
    <div class="codes">
        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
    </div>
    <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h1 id="functions">Function declarations</h1>
    <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The name of the function.</li>
        <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
        <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
    <div class="codes">
        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
    </div>
    <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that<br /> is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
    <div class="codes">
        <code>return number * number;</code>
    </div>
    <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value<br /> of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
